Emerging technologies Management and Risk evaluation on distribution Grids Evolution (EMeRGE) tool
enables impact analysis of distributed energy resources (DER's) on distribution systems via myraid of
metrics. The metrics are categorized into four high-level topics - risk of electric parameter violation,
energy efficiency, transformer loss of life and DER related metrics (e.g. overgeneration for PV).
In each topic area, metrics will be used to assess impact at both system and asset levels.

EMeRGE is a collection of tools allowing user to develop feeder model from GIS data and perform risk analysis and visualize
in an interactive way develpoed using plotly-dash.
