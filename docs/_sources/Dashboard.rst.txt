The package `ResultDashboard` allows user to visuallize results in an interactive dashboard. This dashboard
takes results of package `DSSRiskAnalyzer` as input.

.. autoclass:: ResultDashboard.dashboard.DashApp

   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

In order to make this process easy, you can first call the template class:

.. autoclass:: ResultDashboard.dashboard.Template
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
